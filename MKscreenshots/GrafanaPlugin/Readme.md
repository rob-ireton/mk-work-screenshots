# Grafana plugin
In the days when Grafana was writen in Angular, I created a plugin to show video thumbnails based on historical thumbnail captures. This was to give confidence monitoring of compressed video content. The plugin also acted as a player to loop around the time-series of the current grafana filter context.
What made this really neat however is that by hovering over other graphs, the plugin had an option I put in to locate the thumbnail at that time point so you could hover over say a glitch in another graph and see the video at that point in time. :)
