# Workflows
There was a lot of work in this project to build a system based around the patent I filed regarding scalable views for managing TV compression systems.
The design had many versions from lo-fi to hi-fi - to poc - to prod.
The result was a REACT HTML Canvas based on ReactJS. The idea behind the system was to have a workflow approach to have an abstraction around TV compression pipelines. Main views included a configuration view, a scalable monitoring view and a template builder.
