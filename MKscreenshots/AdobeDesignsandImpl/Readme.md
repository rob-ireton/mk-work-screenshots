# Various designs and implementations

## Aquila designs
The Aquila designs went through many iterations. I started from blank, concepts, low-fi into hi-fi (and eventually worked on impl). Much of the designs were to sell the concepts for inhouse concept approval and testing approval with users or customers.

## Controller
This is a screenshot of a well-known Controller system. I have contributed many design and coded many extensions to this system over the years as the requests arose. Originally adopted before I joined the project, the baseline was a Django suite that set the tone and to some extent the limitations of what we could afford to bring to market. However, it served customers well and we built this to a good level of control with additions of REACT in later phases.

## Design system
I tried to keep the impl team on track with the concepts of the UI with an embedded design system - within the actual design. As we moved in to impl, this served its purpose and could then be retired until we needed extensions since the code produced a defacto framework for similar content to be applied.

## Video Storage
This was a novel approach to manage a legacy system with an updated approach to monitor a cloud video storage system. I generated a new UI concept and based it loosely on a seat booking system. The idea being that from a glance, you can traverse the system and drill down to further status and or control. The initial poc was developed with REACT and AntJS.
