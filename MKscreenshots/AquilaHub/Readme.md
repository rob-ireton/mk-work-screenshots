# Aquila hub (aka Solution Manager)
An active system for managing cloud deployments for video streaming and head ends. I worked a lot on this project, setting up the overall pages, menu system, layout setups and a number of the content pages.
A few of the config pages used a nice in-house plugin to have a inline/ in-place configurator from a lower level system - viewed in an iframe. Of which, I put a wrapper wizard style setup to assist the user from the steps to manage the comprehensive configuration setup.
